## ‚ö° Getting Started (For Developers)

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm) installed.

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AyushSinha2603/sh-website.com.git](https://github.com/AyushSinha2603/sh-website.com.git)
    cd sh-website.com
    ```
    (Note: The `.com` in the repository name seems unusual for a non-domain, you might want to consider renaming your GitHub repo to just `sh-website` or similar if `sh-website.com` is not your actual domain. If it is your domain and this is a monorepo, that's fine.)

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Due to potential peer dependency conflicts with newer React versions, use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag if `npm install` fails.
    ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Open in browser:**
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
